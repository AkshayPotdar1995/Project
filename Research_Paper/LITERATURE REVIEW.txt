In this section, we briefly review the age and gender classification literature and describe both the early methods. The main aim of this method is fixing age and gender classification and checking the accuracy of the model for his or her images. The paper gives us information about the technology used in the gender detection model. The models using an algorithm for detecting 
an image pose prediction and recognition of his or her images using convolutional neural network algorithm it enhances performance and high face detector for improving the speed of the model significantly better in performance and performing many more tasks[1]. We have the prospect to learn a classification method and using a convolutional neural network technique to enhance the performance can be attained by gender classification task that we decide for working on the convolutional neural network[2]. using VGGnet architecture which can be used
 in an extreme level of training data for CNN-based algorithms we supposed our work on 
current unfiltered pictures for his or her gender prediction.
